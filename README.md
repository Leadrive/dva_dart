# dva_dart

A dart lib for managing app's state.

The idea is from `dva.js` ,which is a lightweight inspired by redux, redux-saga, elm.

Though in dart, we have redux and flutter-redux developed by community.

However it is not easy to learn and use even I have learned Redux in Javascript.

When I try use bloc from flutter's community, I find `Stream` in dart and `StreamBuilder` for flutter is powerful.

But it's the different setup and idea from Redux.

Finnally, I decided to use the idea from `dva.js` and the basic structure from `bloc`, using `rxdart` to combine them toghther.

And it might work in a way.

# About flutter

This library is under development, and I know a lot of use case should be `flutter` based.

And I will try to ship them into Flutter ,and create another `flutter-dva` repo somehow.
